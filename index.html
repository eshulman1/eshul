				<p>So you want to start a business, right? Okay, you&#8217;re so lucky. This article will help you plan a new business or expand your existing business. This is a step-by-step guide on how to start, improve, and expand your business while minimizing losses. If you are a beginner, please read this article carefully from the beginning. For those who already have an existing business and want to improve or expand, the second half of this article will be more useful.</p>
<p>Every company starts with an idea. You will notice that throughout the article I have emphasized the psychological aspects of people, not the physical or financial aspects. Call me philosophy, but the thought is where everything happens. I have seen and experienced it for a while. If you are committed wholeheartedly, there is really nothing you cannot do. Let&#8217;s start.</p>
<p><strong>Step 01: Discover your passion</strong></p>
<p>You say &#8220;why is it so important&#8221;? The answer is simple. You really don&#8217;t want to get a tedious job. The new company requires a lot of planning and execution. If you have a passion for it, they won&#8217;t feel the job compared to the company you don&#8217;t like. After all, happiness is the end result of everything in our lives. Why not choose a company that makes you happy when you do business?</p>
<p>&#8220;If the holiday turns into a career, you succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Step 02: Sales</strong></p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve found your enthusiasm, let&#8217;s take a look at how to use it to bill people who need services you can provide. In fact, your enthusiasm is stranger and more unique and you are more likely to succeed because this company does not exist yet. This does not mean that if your enthusiasm is normal or normal you should not do it. Even if this is very common, if you really like it, you will always find other ways of doing things, and other methods are winners themselves.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a passion for cars. You are more likely to succeed in a car repair shop, a car repair shop, or a repair and modification company. Of course, there are many such things, but if you like it, it will be one. Maybe your store has a nice waiting area where customers can sit and have a free drink when they get off or get on the bus, or you can get free stickers to arrange their rest time. You will find this after starting a business.</p>
<p><strong>Step 03: Planning</strong></p>
<p>Write down your unique ideas and prepare a presentation. Take your time. You should not rush to complete this part. If you have new ideas in the middle of the planning phase, you can safely make changes. Edit and adjust until you are completely satisfied and you can see your business situation clearly. I cannot emphasize how important this is. You must be absolutely clear and sure. If some parts are opaque, wait a bit, do something else, and then return to the planning table if your mind is clear. Later you will see how we can repeat this step over and over again.</p>
<p>One thing to remember is that I&#8217;m not talking about &#8220;methods&#8221;. At this point, you are not considering how to start a business. It will be later. At this stage, your focus is on &#8220;Whats&#8221;. When you start thinking about &#8220;how to do it,&#8221; you&#8217;re ruining your plan because you start thinking about things like &#8220;how do I get capital&#8221; and &#8220;how do I find the ideal place.&#8221; When you understand the &#8220;content&#8221; clearly, &#8220;is displayed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 04: Visualize your success</strong></p>
<p>Now that you have a clear view of the business, you can intuitively see what it looks and feels like when it is fully operational and successful. You must be able to taste success. This is another important phase. Why do you want to know that? Your road to success will encounter obstacles. This is a photo that you can continue with. If you need to inspire them during hard times, it also helps your team stay motivated in the future. Leader, you must always have a portrait of success.</p>
<p><strong>Step 05: Requirements</strong></p>
<p>You will be very clear about your business and have a clear understanding of success. So far you&#8217;re mentally prepared, so let&#8217;s start exercising. The actual needs of the company include three things: infrastructure, personnel, and finance.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> If your business is local, such as an auto repair shop, you will need a room, an office, a storage room, and some furniture. If your business is virtual, you need a website or other computer application. In any case, you have a clear picture (step 03), so that you can make a list of infrastructure requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> If you can do something yourself, then you are. If not, you need help. Use step 03 to find out how many people you need and what their jobs and qualifications are. You can also look for friends, relatives, and acquaintances with these qualifications and will be happy to help you in the beginning. It is helpful to have a good friend or partner at this stage. If you have a friend who has almost the same vision as you, you have won the prize. It becomes much easier with good friends.</p>
<p><strong>Finance:</strong> This part is a bit uncomfortable for many people. Therefore, many good ideas have never been seen. Many people will give up this area because they think there is no money. If that&#8217;s how you feel, don&#8217;t forget that the financial industry is built on great ideas. Their goal is to invest. How do you think the Empire State Building was built? One person didn&#8217;t put all the money into it. This idea is great and has received simple support from various financial institutions. The fact is that there are many banks, lenders, and investors looking for good investment ideas.</p>
<p>Ideally, however, as an entrepreneur, you own at least half of the required capital. If you are currently working, you can start saving. If you already have money, start now. If you don&#8217;t have anything, use the Step 03 presentation to attract wealthy family members, friends, or investors.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the article, I mentioned how important the psychological aspects of people are. I want to go into this further because finances are a huge problem. Fear is your only real enemy. This is all you have to overcome, you have to face it anyway. I&#8217;ll give you some tips on how to work, but you should go this way.</p>
<p>First, you can be afraid. This belongs to us. Just remember, &#8220;Courage is not without fear. It is fear and still does what you fear.&#8221; In other words, FACE IT. After all, &#8220;at the end of life, we will only regret things that we have not done or opportunities that we have not accepted.&#8221; What is the worst possible scenario? We are all dead It is better to die and do what we enjoy than to live a boring, boring, safe, and comfortable life. Use step 04 and taste success, then go there. Here are several fears you may have and how to overcome them:</p>
<p>Fear of rejection: Yes, you are being rejected. Not many people will understand what you are going to do, so don&#8217;t treat it as an individual, but move on to the next. When giving a presentation, be prepared for the best and be passionate. People invest in dishonesty. I know I will do it. If I see someone who is really passionate about the project, even if I don&#8217;t understand it, I will invest myself. why? Since he does not give up until he succeeds, it is worth taking step 01.</p>
<p>Fear of loss: there is always the possibility of loss. After all, this is a new company and you don&#8217;t know all the dilemmas. Believe in yourself, if you make a mistake and lose, you will also know how to get rid of it. This is your idea and you know it best. The loss will happen when it happens and you know what to do &#8211; no need to worry now.</p>
<p>Fear of shame: Yes, some people always say something, especially when you&#8217;re in trouble. You are laughed at and ridiculed. But if you come to triumph, will it be sweeter? If you have never been defeated, how can you win? Be prepared for shame and failure, use step 04 at these times and then win another winner. People remember heroes, not ordinary people.</p>
<p>I hope the tips on anxiety can help you overcome anxiety. Now that you have found a capital provider, there is one thing to consider. Looking for an investor who is willing to wait for the business to run normally, ideally 6 to 8 months. Some investors, banks or lenders borrow money from you, but they almost want their benefits or return on investment (ROI). This is nearsighted.</p>
<p>A wise investor knows that if the company is not fully operational and will start withdrawing money, the company will not succeed and the money will not be returned. Therefore, choose someone who will wait. In this way, the company can be safe and investors can achieve the full return on investment.</p>
<p><strong>Step 06: Start</strong></p>
<p>Find your location, find your people, and move on. Use your partner as a good hand and divide the work. One can find a place and buy furniture, the other can be rented. Hire the best people. Remember that the first batch of employees will be your core team, and you should easily work with them. Remember step 03 so you know how many people you need and what qualifications they should have.</p>
<p><strong>Step 07: Employees</strong></p>
<p>Make sure everyone knows what they are doing. Formulate a fair employment policy to reward good jobs. In addition, before you let go, make sure there are no employees who are truly capable of getting the opportunity and training. Sometimes it is beneficial to link a good employee to another bad employee so that the bad employee can learn from the good employee. You can also create a profit-sharing plan. This way, employees can take care of you as if they were doing their own business.</p>
<p><strong>Step 08: Market</strong></p>
<p>Market your business and do it professionally. After you start a business, you need to attract as many customers as possible. You can ask professional photographers to take pictures of your institution and graphic designers to create brochures.</p>
<p>Being online is also important. Make a good website. Nowadays this is simple, but if you are capable of it, pass it on to IT professionals. See if you can make apps for smartphones for the services provided. Offer promotions and discounts on brochures and websites.</p>
<p>Regularly meet your core team to discuss how to improve service or attract more customers. Keep an open mind, accept all ideas, and choose the one that suits you best and implement it. There are several ways to market your business: door to door marketing, telemarketing, SEO, API (create an application), advertising.</p>
<p>In my next article, I will only focus on marketing strategies</p>
<p><strong>Step 09: Expand</strong></p>
<p>Expand your business. You now have a business model, so all you have to do is copy and paste, so don&#8217;t decline the option to expand. If this is a local business serving only local customers, open another branch or start franchising to another city. Financing should not be a problem at this time. A large number of investors and financiers are happy to give you money. If it&#8217;s an online business, expand your SEO or customer support team, the world will become your market.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10: Balance</strong></p>
<p>The last but not the least point is to balance everything you do. From the first step to the end, balance is key. The lesson of balance is tremendous, but I&#8217;ll cover it briefly.</p>
<p>Too many things are bad. Don&#8217;t work too hard to avoid losing family, friends or health. After all, if you can&#8217;t share money with your loved ones, or if you have to spend the most money in hospitals, money is bad. You must maintain a balance between business and private life. Moreover, if you are always tired, there is no good idea. If you&#8217;re stuck, let go for a moment and come back. You will find a solution.</p>
<p>Life and business are ups and downs. The lesson of balance also teaches us to be careful when we succeed and be patient when we fail. If successful, don&#8217;t spend unnecessary money on unnecessary things. Likewise, if you fail, don&#8217;t give up, because success is just around the corner. This is darkest before sunrise, so &#8220;this will pass too&#8221;.</p>
<p>You also need to find a balance between you and your employees. You are their leader. If you take them too hard, they will stop and make things worse. If you are too soft, they will play a bigger role.</p>
<p>After all, everything is about people. From employees to investors to clients, please balance all relationships. Share and enjoy your success.</p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong></p>
<p>I collected the information in this article from various life coaches, inspiring speakers, and my own life experience as a business developer. I hope to help you. Dreams come true, move on.</p>
